# CSC307GroupProject-Inventory 
## Project Overview ## 
This is the inventory app for CSC 307. 
It manages products, stores, and locations, including details like product quantity and price. 

## Core Entities ## 
- Store (StoreID)
- Location (ID) 
- Product (ProductID, Quantity, Price) 

## Contributing ##
To keep our code consistent across the team, we use ESLint and Prettier (implemented through the react-frontend) 

## Setup ##
After pulling the repository: 
1. Navigate to the frontend
2. Install all dependencies
   npm install 
3. Check for style or syntax issues while coding
   npm run lint (terminal will list lines where code is not in line with Prettier)
   npm run lint -- --fix (terminal will automatically find and fix all code to follow Prettier syntax format)
